	<h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
	<p>For years my job has been to perform <a href="https://youtu.be/H_3V9xlDMA0">Echocardiogram tests</a> on people. While I have truly enjoyed this career, all along I've secretly wanted to be a Front End developer. Each day I discover new, beautiful, well designed pages on the web. Then one day I discovered Thinkful while searching for education options and decided this was my chance to achieve my goal.</p>

	<h1 class="heading">Where I'm From</h1>
	<p>I'm originally from <a href="http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=7609&picture=pittsburgh-at-sunset&large=1">Pittsburgh Pennsylvania</a>, but moved to Cleveland Ohio years ago. Now I live in <a href="http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=90634&picture=roebling-suspension-bridge&large=1">Akron Ohio </a>and love it. I'm just a short drive away from beautiful parks and the water which is great. </p>
	<p>My orignial degree was in Nuclear Medicine Technology, but working in a technical medical field has helped to make me a lifetime learner. I'm also a certified Technical Trainer, and am currently enrolled in Thinkful's Front End Web Development course.</p>
